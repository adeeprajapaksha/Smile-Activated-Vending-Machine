# Smile-Activated-Vending-Machine
On Valentine’s Day 2024, we spread smiles and surprises with our Smile-Activated Vending Machine!<br>

As part of a special brand activation, we combined cutting-edge technology and creativity to deliver an interactive experience that left everyone smiling. Here’s how it worked:

✨ Using machine learning technology with TensorFlow and OpenCV, our system detected when two people smiled together in front of the camera.<br>
✨ Holding their smiles for 3 seconds triggered the camera to capture their photo.<br>
✨ A custom-built, Arduino-powered vending machine then dispensed a special discount card for the brand, giving participants a reason to celebrate even more.<br>

And there’s more!<br>
💌 The captured images were uploaded to a beautifully designed online gallery, where participants could view their moments. They could also select their photo and request it to be sent directly to their WhatsApp for keepsakes.
