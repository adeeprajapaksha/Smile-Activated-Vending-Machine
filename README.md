# Smile-Activated-Vending-Machine
On Valentine’s Day 2024, we created a Smile-Activated Vending Machine! Using machine learning, it detected two people smiling for 3 seconds, captured their photo, and dispensed a brand discount card via an Arduino-powered machine. Photos were showcased online, allowing users to share them via WhatsApp. Smiles met innovation and connection!
